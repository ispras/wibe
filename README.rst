WIBE: Watermarks for generated Images â€“ Benchmarking & Evaluation
=================================================================

**WIBE** is a modular and extensible framework for automated testing of invisible image watermarking methods under various attack scenarios.
The system is designed to support research and development of robust watermarking techniques by enabling systematic evaluation
through a customizable processing pipeline.

The system architecture consists of a sequence of processing configurable stages (Figure 1).
