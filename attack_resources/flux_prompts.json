    "base": "You are an image analysis expert. Your task is to create a concise, technical caption that describes how to modify the provided image to remove its watermark. This caption will be used as an instruction for the FluxContext model. Analyze the image and generate a single-sentence instruction in English. The instruction must specify: What to remove (e.g., 'text', 'logo', 'semi-transparent text'). Its precise location (e.g., 'in the bottom right corner'). Key visual characteristics of the area underneath it that need to be reconstructed (e.g., 'the texture of the ocean water', 'the brick wall pattern', 'the skin tone and hair'). Your goal is to guide FluxContext to erase the watermark while making the smallest possible change to the original image. The final result should look natural and unedited.",
    "camera_change": "Create a short instruction for generating an image showing how this scene would appear if the camera had shifted slightly to the left/right. Keep the description concise while maintaining essential details about lighting and composition.",
    "add_details": "Act as a creative image analyst. Analyze this photograph and identify small, plausible, and contextually appropriate enhancement that could be made. This should be minimal, point-based edit that add to or slightly alter existing elements without changing the scene's essence. Focus on objects that are commonly added in photo edits (e.g., a bird in the sky, a cherry on a dessert, a leaf on a tree, changing the color of a single object).For your top suggestion, generate a single, concise, and direct instruction for an image editing AI. The instruction must be specific and include the exact object to add or change, its precise location anf a brief descriptor of its appearance. The final output should look authentic and must not make the image seem heavily manipulated or AI-generated.",
    "find_wm": "Act as a visual AI analyst. First, identify the most likely zones in this image where a watermark or logo would be placed (e.g., corners, center, over textured regions). Then, based on that analysis, generate a single, highly specific instruction to guide another AI in modifying those specific zones. The modification should be a lightweight image processing operation (like inpainting, frequency filtering, or color matching) designed to remove artificial overlays while reconstructing plausible image content. The final output should look authentic and unedited.",
    "pixel_level": "Analyze this image and identify any superficial elements that are not part of the main content, such as small logos, text, or graphical watermarks. Generate a concise, single-sentence instruction for an image editing model to make minimal, pixel-level alterations to specifically neutralize these elements. The instruction must focus only on the affected areas and should preserve the overall integrity, color balance, and sharpness of the original image. Do not describe the changes, just provide the direct instruction.",
    "texture_based": "This image has a watermark overlayed on it. Your task is to generate a short command for an image AI to gently modify the local texture and noise pattern in the precise area where the watermark is located. The goal is to make the watermark blend in seamlessly by slightly altering the micro-details of the image in that zone. The command should specify a texture-based operation (e.g., slight blurring, noise addition, texture synthesis) and must be constrained to the minimal area necessary to avoid affecting the global image quality.",
    "camera_shift_effect": "Generate an instruction for an image generation model to simulate a slight, imperceptible lateral shift of the camera perspective. The result should be as if the camera was moved 10-12 pixels to the left or right, causing a minimal geometric transformation that crops and re-centers the image content. This should subtly displace any fixed elements overlayed on the frame. The output must retain the original content's composition and must not look like a noticeable translation.",
    "color_microshift_prompt": "Generate a subtle color adjustment instruction for FluxContext. Target: shift hue of dominant color areas by 3-5% in HSV space. Example: 'Adjust wall hue toward mauve by 4%' or 'Cool down sky tones by 3%'. Focus on minimal perceptual change.",
    "texture_refinement_prompt": "Create a texture enhancement command for FluxContext. Target: micro-textures in mid-frequency areas. Example: 'Enhance wood grain visibility marginally' or 'Refine fabric texture definition slightly'. Use minimal sharpening (radius 0.5-1px).",
    "corner_enhancement": "Analyze the corners of this image. Identify one corner that appears slightly less detailed or flatter than the others. Generate a concise instruction for an image model to enhance the texture and detail in that specific corner to match the rest of the photo. Be precise about the location (e.g., 'bottom left corner').",
    "color_gradient_correction": "Analyze the color gradients in this image. Find a small area where the gradient could be smoother or more continuous. Provide an instruction to perform a minor color gradient correction in that specific localized area to improve flow."
